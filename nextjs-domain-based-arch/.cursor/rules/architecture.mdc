# Project Architecture

This project follows a modular, library-based architecture to promote a strong separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability.

## Directory Structure

- For any code that not related to NextJS or React JS put it into /src/lib/<lib_name>

- For any pages must follow nextjs naming route convention

- For any components that use only in that pages it must be inside same pages directory the directory must not routable by NextJS such as `_components`

- For any custom hooks that use only that pages must be the same directory of pages files must be inside directory called `_hooks`

- Using Grouping pattern for re-use layout files of for grouping route by using `(<group_name>)`
